# AltMoviePosters.bundle
Plex agent that gets posters from alternativemovieposters.com  
Note the followings issues
- Searched can only be based on the movie's title, sometimes that results in the wrong posters
- Some posters that borders, which the agent can't cut off (if anyone has an idea how let me know)
