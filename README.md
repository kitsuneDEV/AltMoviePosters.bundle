# AltMoviePosters.bundle
A Plex agent that finds posters from alternativemovieposters.com 
Note the followings issues
- Searches can only be based on movie title, sometimes that results in the wrong posters in the results
- Some posters have borders, which the agent can't cut off (if anyone has an idea how let me know)
